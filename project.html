                This is an ongoing project. As being selected as a sponsored team,
                we receive $100,000 stipend to start an AI socialBot research.
                Our ambition is to eliminate the frustrating experience in the
                interactions with existing sicalBots. Our socialbot is meant to
                support daily conversation with human by using a sophisticated
                context tracking model. Its basic functionality is generating and
                recording important idea, concepts or topics during a conversation,
                to maintain the coherence of chatting. More importantly, our
                socialbot should be able to detect context distraction, context
                missing and context combination from the speaker and use it as
                guidance for generating responses. As the conversation goes, the
                context will keep changing and be filled. And it will finally
                arrive at a topic which is of interest to the speaker.

                Before I started my master program, I worked shortly in
                Eigen Technologies, a data science startup. I participated in
                the Nakhoda Project, which is an intelligent legal document
                analysis system. Nakhoda can learn patterns from training data
                and then apply the patterns to find answers for specific
                questions on the uploaded documents. I was responsible for
                the core module, the patterns learning module. I invented a
                pattern learning and searching algorithm based on text
                embedding mechanism. The algorithm significantly improved the
                result accuracy. I also refactored the system architecture to
                make the system more robust and flexible. After I left Eiegn,
                other engineers are still working on this project to explore
                the power of data science in the legal domain.

                Zuoye Bang is an educational mobile application that assists
                elementary and secondary school students in seeking instructions,
                studying related topics and finding similar exercises when they
                encounter difficult problems. The mission of the product is
                to eliminate the imbalance of educational resources among
                different areas. The core technologies of this project include
                optical character recognition (OCR), information retrieval,
                data mining, multimedia processing. I was responsible for the
                backend search system in this project. As of August 2015,
                the product had attracted 50 million users, accumulated 95
                million exercises, and responded to 4 billion questions.
                The product was adopted by 113 educational
                institutions and 370,000 elementary and secondary schools.
                Baidu had demerged this product into a new company assessed
                at one hundred million dollars. Zuoye Bang is now the leading mobile
                educational product in the Chinese market.

                As we know, China has the largest population in the world, and
                there are only limited healthcare resources. It might spend
                patients several hours or even a day waiting in the queue but
                only get a diagnosis from doctors within several minutes.
                When users are not feeling well about their health, they might
                want to ask for suggestions before going to the hospital.
                If it is not a serious problem, they can take care of themselves.
                If they need further examinations, they also want suggestions on
                which department of the hospital they should go.
                Within our platform, users can log in the website and
                describe their symptoms online. And then doctors who
                are in partnerships with our platform will provide a preliminary
                diagnosis or some healthcare suggestions to the users. I was
                responsible for the core data flow in this project, including
                data processing, data storage, and data analysis.

                Baidu Zhidao is an online knowledge sharing community. At each
                question page, this is a recommendation section, which recommends
                a list of related questions and answers. I refactored the
                recommendation system by adding a recommendation engine based
                on users' behavior, which improved the click rate by 7% in the
                AB test. The major challenges of this project included <b>big data
                analysis</b> (abstracting fectures from one billion question-answer
                pairs), <b>data storage</b> (implementing index structure to store one
                billion nodes in a graph to provide efficient recommendation
                service.), <b>system design</b> (refactoring the recommendation system
                to integrate the new engine without affecting the original
                service.).

                on Baidu search results. There were nearly 30 engineers in

                for the process of query analysis in a distributed search engine.
                I also maintained a multi-layered SVM classification model.
                This model automatically predicted the possible product category
                of input queries to provide accurate results. This was my first project
                related to machine learning nad natural language processing.

                IPv6-IPv6 Network Address Port Translation (NAPT66) is a
                stateful IPv6 NAT software. The motivation of this project
                was to improve the network security in IPv6 environment.
                I developed this project with two classmates in my undergraduate.
                NAPT66 was implemented in the Linux kernel space. We deployed NAPT66
                on an OpenWrt router to provide IPv6-IPv6 NAT service. This
                project was awarded the <b>Outstanding Innovation Project</b> by Beijing
